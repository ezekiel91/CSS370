            - Got Android Studios working, updated with BIOS settings to run visualization for android emulator
            - Created an Understanding for what algorithms need to be implemented
            - Created this file so we can commit our Non code work and show progress

            - learned the Android Studios enviorment and how it works together, this is what took most of my time
            - Figured out how to create a button in kotlin
            - Figured out how to send the input from the button back to the mainactivity of the program
            - Need to figure out how to integrate this on to the teams code so it works there

            The code from this:

                fun LikeButton(view: View?): Boolean
                {
                    return true //write here to return a like value
                }
            
                fun DislikeButton(view: View?): Boolean
                {
                    return false  //write here to return a dislike value
                }

            - switched from kotlin to Python
            - Figured out how to set up the github repo on to a machine
            - got the video player to work 
            - found SDK website and started learning how to implement it on to the machine
            - Had problems connecting brainBit to the SDK but aim to resolve the issue by finding a machine that can run it properly by monday 11/6

            - set up VS code and all the dependancies for the code to make it work and run on my home machine, mainly had issues trying to get the right commands to input on my home PC to get this to run

            - Went through and studied some off the calls needed for this project
            - looked through the code and found where the code will be needed to be implemented in order to get it running later
            - Mainly learned how the REST server worked, being able to understand what is happening and where really helps me better how my code will effect the program and why it does work
            - trouble shooting the drivers on my laptop to see if it would support BT4, no luck here
            - conversated with team mates to see who has a machine that does have BL4, Morgan says she has one that should work, so we will see come monday

            - wrote google Doc for two week sprint submission for the midterm grade
12/3/2023

here is my python code for my JIRA ticket - Does the user like our video?

#Does the user like the video we presented?
#parameter - input from headband that gives user retention
#return - boolean
def UserRetention(retention): ## retention is a floating value
    if retention > 0.5: ## greater then half retention value
        return True ## if the user likes the video we return True
    else:
        return False ## if the user does not like the video we return false
