            - Figured out how to create a button in kotlin
            - Figured out how to send the input from the button back to the mainactivity of the program
            - Need to figure out how to integrate this on to the teams code so it works there

            The code from this:

    fun LikeButton(view: View?) //takes in code from the app button
    {
        //write here to return a like value
    }

    fun DislikeButton(view: View?)
    {
        //write here to return a dislike value
    }
