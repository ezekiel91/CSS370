Created google document with links to youtube shorts and videos that we can download and use in our project. 
Also did reserach on how to use Ai captioning apps to caption videos in order to retain attention from users
At first only decided to find videos pertaining to highschoool math, however realized this would be much more difficult to find short formv videos for that age group.
Decided to scrap that idea and target kids age range from 5-10 ish instead as teaching math is much easier and thus shorter in videos for that age group

October 18- 
Downloaded Android Studios(Screenshot uploaded with time stamp to jira) and began setting up the application and attempting to follow the SDK instructions from brainbit

October 25- 
Long break due to midterms but re opened the SDK and got to work. Started off smoothly then slowly started running into problems.
At first it was very difficult to even navigate android studio or understand what was what and where to implement the SDK.
I used this video to get a introductory understanding of the app. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBWyXo-3JGQ)
After watching this I again began to work on the SDK but I kept getting bugs.
