Created google document with links to youtube shorts and videos that we can download and use in our project. 
Also did reserach on how to use Ai captioning apps to caption videos in order to retain attention from users
At first only decided to find videos pertaining to highschoool math, however realized this would be much more difficult to find short formv videos for that age group.
Decided to scrap that idea and target kids age range from 5-10 ish instead as teaching math is much easier and thus shorter in videos for that age group

Downloaded Android Studios(Screenshot uploaded with time stamp) and began setting up the application and attempting to follow the SDK instructions from brainbit
