November 27th(1-2 hours) - 
Began doing research on how to execute the task of holding videos on a server before class. Came to class with a vague understanding 
of how to hold videos in a server without having all of them in a directory within vs code. In class I was told a json file
could solve this problem. After class I went home and began researching on ways to implement a json file into a html page to store
videos for me.
