November 27th(1 hour) - 
Began doing research on how to execute the task of holding videos on a server before class. Came to class with a vague understanding 
of how to hold videos in a server without having all of them in a directory within vs code. In class I was told a json file
could solve this problem. After class I went home and began researching on ways to implement a json file into a html page to store
videos for me. 

Novemeber 28th(3 hours)-
I watched a quick video on json files (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM) and then began researching how to play videos within CS code with 
JSON files. After some research I began writing code in order to play videos using a JSON file. I started with a small JSON file code-
[
  {
    "id": "video1",
    "title": "Video 1",
    "url": "file:///path/to/movie.mp4"
  },
  {
    "id": "video2",
    "title": "Video 2",
    "url": "file:///path/to/movie2.mp4"
  }
 ]
This did not take me long to write but the function for playing videos via JSON took a second as I did not understand how to go about doing that.
After a while of struggling I think I gave up and decided to pick up after class the next day as I dont have any more code from this day in my notes.
So after doing some more research  I was able to find a way to play JSON videos or so I thought I did. I began reworking my code in order to function with a JSON file. After lots of stack and geeksforgeeks searching I was able to come up with a function 
for playing the JSON videos. It was honestly much simpler then I thought I was just making it hard for no reason. Although bits and pieces of my previous code was 
altered significantly the below code was the most prevalent in getting the JSON to work I thought-

  $.getJSON("videos.json", function(data) {
                videos = data;
                playVideo(0);
            });

            var currentVideoIndex = 0;

            function playVideo(index) {
                currentVideoIndex = index;
                var currentVideo = videos[currentVideoIndex];
                var videoElement = document.getElementById("video");
                videoElement.src = currentVideo.url;
                videoElement.play();
                updateButtons();
            }

            function play_start() {
                $.post("/open_api/play_movie", { "data": "somedata", "any": "data" },
                    function(data, textStatus) {
                        console.log(data);
                    }, "json").fail(function(response) {
                        console.log("error");
                        console.log(response);
                    });
            }

            function VideoEnded() {
                $.post("/open_api/video_ended", { "data": "somedata", "any": "data" },
                    function(data, textStatus) {
                        console.log(data);
                        skipVideo();
                    }, "json").fail(function(response) {
                        console.log("error");
                        console.log(response);
                    });
            }

Novemeber 29th(1-2 hours after class)-
So what I realized quickly after testing my code that I came up for the JSON file was that it did not play anything within the videplayer. After asking
the professor I learned its due to security restrictions and he gave me some advice to try to open it without using chrome or disabling secuirty through the
terminal. After getting home I attempted to do research on why this was occuring and if there was anyway around it. I found myself in a rabbit hole of videos
or random forums trying to fix this problem. I wasn't willing to disable security for it so I just kept watching videos on the topic like this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZd1JWmLGLk)
but after watching and reading a lot of different things I would realize most of it barely related. I decided to call it a day and instead worked on making the content better that was being
displayed. 

Dec 2(1 hour)- 
Took a small break due to other commitments. But on this day I began working towards getting the show Like/Dislike videos to work correctly instead of how it was 
before. At the end of last sprint I was only able to display the file names for the videos as text. My goal by the end of this sprint was being able to see the videos
within a pop up so users did not have to naviagate to another page. I tried to challenge myself here and just tweak the modals I already created but ended up just getting
many errors.
