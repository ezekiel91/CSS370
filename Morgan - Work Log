From Research:

****Impostant
Simplicity and Clarity:
- Keep the interface clean and uncluttered.
- Use simple and easily understandable language and icons.

Search Functionality:
- Implement a search feature for videos.
- Make the search bar easily accessible.

User Onboarding:
- Create a user-friendly onboarding process to guide new users.
- Explain how to use the app and highlight key features (connecting headband to bluetooth).

Theming and Dark Mode:
- Consider offering different themes, including a dark mode option for users who prefer it (so the app is not so bright and distracting when focusing on work).


first mock up ---> FLow Chart

Second ---> Figma 

////////////////////////////////////////     10/25



Work has been on pause because of midterms but my last midterm is on 10/26.


I am going to create a flowchart by hand using good notes (on my ipad) because its best to reflect my ideas using my own handwriting and drawing.
When updated I will upload it to Jira to show my progress.

The flowchart will reflect the flow I want with the ui-ux. This includes: buttons, tabs, different pages, text, and pop ups.
After my first mock-up I will reflect with the group and ask people (users) for critique.
Based on that I will make the final flowchart with approval of the group.

After the flowchart I need to start my final draft of the UI. I am planning on using Figma but have to play with it a bit first as it is my first time using that 
application. I know I can import my work from figma to android studio so it is the best option for now.

////////////////////////////////////////     10/28

these are the pages im going to have for the flowchart:

signup/login
Log in
sign up
Connect to bluetooth/ example helping user put on headband
page featuring a search bar (thumbnails)
video page

---> still a possibilty more pages will be addedd if needed.

Currently I have the flowchar for the starting page, log-in page, sig-up page, and connect to bluetooth/ put on headband page.
Sent to the group discord for review!
Will be continuing to work on the other pages for the flowchart... see Jira for progress.
