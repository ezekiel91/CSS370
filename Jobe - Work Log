Summary after review
The review helped open my eyes to the importance of Jira tickets and how I should keep track of my work. More specific individual work was tracked on Github. 
After looking back at 360 review, my 2 week sprint summary, and the Trello review I noticed how I need to keep working on staying on top of updating my worklogs 
and Jira tickets right after I accomplish any work. I had some screenshots on the Jira but I would like to add links to the different documents I was working on 
myself. I was also able to set up an interview with a family friend and I already spent some time explaining to her about this product as she was interested 
in it to help her daughter with autism to effectively learn better. I have set up the interview after the Thanksgiving break as I would like to keep working on
my speaking skills on the side. As I stated in my 2 week sprint summary, a good amount of time was spent trying to research, understand, and figure out issues
in Kotlin and on the backend of the sprint, HTML. This process and the 360 review helped direct me into what I can work on individually through different useful
skills.
