- Did last check ins and updates on both the github and the jira boards.
- Create Narrative after reviewing worklog.
- Spent some time reviewing and updating github as some work log days weren't all completely up to track.

Summary after review
The review helped open my eyes to the importance of Jira tickets and how I should keep track of my work. More specific individual work was tracked on Github. 
After looking back at 360 review, my 2 week sprint summary, and the Trello review I noticed how I need to keep working on staying on top of updating my worklogs 
and Jira tickets right after I accomplish any work. I had some screenshots on the Jira but I would like to add links to the different documents I was working on 
myself. I was also able to set up an interview with a family friend and I already spent some time explaining to her about this product as she was interested 
in it to help her daughter with autism to effectively learn better. I have set up the interview after the Thanksgiving break as I would like to keep working on
my speaking skills on the side. As I stated in my 2 week sprint summary, a good amount of time was spent trying to research, understand, and figure out issues
in Kotlin and on the backend of the sprint, HTML. This process and the 360 review helped direct me into what I can work on individually through different useful
skills.

Summary 

After the reflection from last sprint and getting more comfortable with what we had to do with the project and as 
a team I felt like I had a better idea of what to do for this sprint. I enjoyed what I got done in this sprint and 
working with my team. I hope to keep working on both my team skills, communication, technical skills and time management
moving forward after this class. I appreciated the new scope this class gave me into the CS field and I hope to take what I 
learned to the next level. I spent a good amount of time understanding html and this was a good time
to use different resources to learn. I enjoyed the team aspect and this process even led me to conduct an interview which was 
cool. Below are the links to my work, I added screenshots on Jira and some explainations above of my work. I hope to finish this
off with a demo of what I have gotten done as well as my team. Making final adjustments to both the Interview notes and the 
tutorial video but will soon add that. Thanks for the semester.
